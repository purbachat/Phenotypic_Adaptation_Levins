# Phenotypic_Adaptation_Levins
Population level simulations for selection and mutation using the framework of Levins' fitness sets.

Population_dynamics.ipynb: Contains the general code used for all population level simulations, outlining how the optimal phenotype is evaluated from the fitness set framework, and how selection acts on a population through an effective fitness function which peaks at the optimal phenotype and has an effective tolerance calculated from the environmental tolerances. Variations of this code can be used to generate Fig. 1, Fig. 2(a,b,d,e,f), Fig. 3, Fig. 4(b-f), Fig. 5(b), Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. S1, Fig. S2, Fig. S6 and Fig. S7(a-c).

vBounds.ipynb: Contains the general code used to compute upper and lower bounds on the rate of environmental change. Variations of this code can be used to generate Fig. 4(a), Fig. 5(a), Fig. S3, Fig. S4, fig. S5, Fig. S7(e-h) and Fig. S8.

Critical_p_vs_asymmetry.ipynb: Contains the code to calculate the critical value p_c as a function of tolerance asymmetries. Can be uysed to generate Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S7(d).
